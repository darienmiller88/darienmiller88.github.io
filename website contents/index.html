                    <p> Seriously, fucking kill me right now T_T  <br/> Why did I wait so long to do this bullshit?!! </p>
                    <p> 
                        It is currently 2:37 AM, and i'm contemplating whether or not all this bullshit is worth my 
                        time you know? I had a whole month to learn html and css and engage in class, and instead, I chose
                        to do ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOTHING. Man, I really amaze myself sometimes -__-+. Hopefully I can get
                        at least a 60 since I didn't had in the first project.

                        So after the exam, I'm actually feeling really good about it! I could have easily gotten a 100 if I had studied for it harder.
                        The HTML part was pretty tricky
